### 2. Wireframes

### 2.1 Mobile screen

As I was searching online, I found a sample portfolio website *([link to sample portfolio website](https://tangerine-hummingbird-1479b6.netlify.app/#projects))* that had caught my attention. I like its hero section because of its simplicity, nice typography and good use of white spaces.

For my website, I want the greetings "Hello, I'm" goes first before the profile photo and name. Also, I want to put only the call to action buttons for Github and LinkedIn.

### 2.1.1 Home Page

When a user visits my website, they will see right away who I am (Name and Photo) and what I do (Full Stack Web Developer). Below it are buttons for my Github and LinkedIn profiles should they want to check my activities.

Since the viewport width of mobile screen is small, the navigation menu is hidden and replaced with hamburger icon. The navigation menu will appear once the icon is clicked.

If you scroll down the home page, there will be the projects section. The image is a screenshot of the website. The next sections my skills, school and the footer. In the skills section, an icon is placed beside each skill.

There are two ways to return to home page, it is done by clicking the logo or the "home" in navigation menu.
